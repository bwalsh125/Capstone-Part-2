Detecting Anomalies in Wafer Manufacturing

- Bryan Walsh

ASIC companies spend many resources for producing quality products within the automotive and medical device industries.  Detecting issues at the Wafer level can greatly save on those resources as manufacturing levels increase.

Can we use machine learning techniques to categorize anomalies and build a model to predict future problems?

I based my studies on the following dataset found on kaggle.com:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arbazkhan971/anomaly-detection

I explored using ML models such as Logistic Regress, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive-bays and Support Vector Machines.

The dataset was challenging because only 8% were labeled as anomalies. K-Nearest Neighbors seemed to provide the best predictions.

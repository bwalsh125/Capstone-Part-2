The research question you intend to answer (one sentence, if possible)
Can we use machine learning techniques to categorize anomolies and build a model to predict future problems.

Your expected data source(s) (either a link to existing data or a sentence describing where you will source the data from)
I found this set of data on wafer manufacturing from kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arbazkhan971/anomaly-detection

The techniques you expect to use in your analysis:
Most likely use KNN to create classifications and identify anomolies.  Explore other classification models and compare performance.

The expected results:
A small number of data points should be detectable as anomolies.

Why this question is important
This hits home in my current line of work where we find defects traced to wafer issues.  I hope this exploration can provide some insights into techniques I can use to explore real data.
